I am a 1st year PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Computer Science department at the University of Southern California, studying socially assistive robotics under Dr. Maja Matarić in the Interaction Lab. I am currently exploring the way that robots elicit and display empathy as a means of improving robots’ emotional intelligence as part of the NSF Expeditions in Computing grant.

I completed my B.S. in Engineering at Harvey Mudd College where I worked under Dr. Christopher Clark in the Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics where I conducted research on autonomous underwater vehicles. I also previously worked on robotics-related projects for Techmation, Northrop Grumman, Doosan Bobcat, and Booz Allen Hamilton.
