                        I'm an engineer turned designer who is passionate about creating great user experiences and examining the relationship between users and technology. I rely on my background in engineering and computer science as much as I rely on my passion for art, design, and project management. I completed my B.S. in engineering at Harvey Mudd in 2018 and my M.S. in computer science at USC in May 2020. I am now looking for roles in User Experience (UX) or Product Design, either remote or in Orange County, CA.

                <p>
                    As a PhD student, I researched how empathy can be incorporated into human-robot interactions by learning about the developmental psychology of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and leading a team of 5 undergraduate and high school students to design a socially assistive robotic empathy tutoring system supported by robust computational models. You can view more project details <a href="http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/projects/desc2.php?name=empathy">here</a>. I was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP). I graduated with my M.S. in computer science in May 2020.

                    I modernized a company’s website through the creation of new media and a responsive site redesign while maintaining the desired information architecture. I designed and developed the new website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The new website features an improved visual design consistent with the company’s new directions and objectives, responsive display, improved typography and media presentation, and integration with external media, such as Google maps.

                    I created image processing algorithms to be run on FPGAs onboard drones while learning about the consulting process.

                <p>
                    During my undergraduate years, I had various jobs on campus. I worked at Homework Hotline for 4 years as an over-the-phone tutor for children in grades 4-12. I served as a mentor tutor, which entailed conducting training exercises, supervising other tutors, taking difficult calls, addressing technical difficulties, and publicizing the hotline at local schools. This position gave me the opportunity to develop my leadership and communication skills while influencing program strategy. I also worked as a grader for the engineering department, grading homework and lab assignments weekly for Numerical Methods in Engineering and Digital Electronics and Computer Engineering. When I wasn't working at Homework Hotline or as a grader, I was showing prospective students and their families around campus as a tour guide for 2.5 years.

                    At Northrop Grumman in Huntsville, AL, I worked alongside executive stakeholders to design a dashboard solution to support some of their complex, reoccurring performance reporting needs. I learned about wireframing through this opportunity, using PowerPoint and Excel to walk stakeholders through the functionality of the dashboard during presentations. At Northrop Grumman Remotec in Clinton, TN, I conducted verification and testing as part of research and development of hazardous operations robots.

                    I worked in Dr. Christopher Clark’s Lab for Autonomous & Intelligent Robotics and was a Rose Hills Foundation fellow on the National Science Foundation-funded ICEX 2016 team. Using an OceanServer Iver 2 with VectorMap and Matlab, we collected video and sonar data of wrecks to be turned into 3D visualizations for archaeologists at the Univeristy of Malta. I developed image processing algorithms in MATLAB to autonomously detect wrecks in large sonar scans. This work led to two publications.

I studied human-robot interaction and socially assistive robotics under Dr. Maja Matarić in the Interaction Lab. I explored how to build a socially assistive robotic empathy tutoring system to help children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as part of the NSF Expeditions in Computing grant. Simultaneously, I pursued coursework in user experience design and strategy. I took a leave of absence from the PhD program after completing my M.S. degree in computer science in May 2020.

I also researched student leadership styles with Dr. Donald Remer and published the results of that research. As part of my clinic capstone experience, I built and tested a new modular AUV for Techmation and automated a complex machine function for compact track loaders for Doosan Bobcat, for which I am listed as an inventor on two separate patent applications.
