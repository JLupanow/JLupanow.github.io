## The Challenge

There is an ever-growing expectation for all businesses to support e-commerce.[^1] 
People want to order a flower arrangement online from a local shop with the same ease they order ahead for a coffee or place an Amazon order.
But small business owners often don't have the time or money to move their operations online, especially if they rely on complex processes that require a "human in the loop" to make a sale.

Petal Pushers is a small floral shop serving the Los Angeles area for over 20 years. 
They are known for their excellent customer service and fresh arrangements made to order. 
With over 70 five star reviews on Yelp, they're a popular local choice, but the ratings began dropping in 2019 with many reviewers blaming the out-of-date website.
With outdated graphics, broken links, non-functional flash player plug-ins, and non-responsive displays, the original site was not an accurate reflection of the shop's emphasis on quality and attention to detail.

The challenge for the owner was that his florists crafted each arrangement based on talking to the customer about their budget and preferences. 
The florist and the customer would work together, either in person or over the phone, to come up with the best arrangement. 
So the owner thought that he couldn't sell arrangements online because he wouldn't be able to replicate this personalized process. 
I needed to find a way to bring his operations online with a new responsive website design.

This project needed to be completed within one semester (i.e. 5 months) and within a budget of $100 (which was to be used for user research and usability testing).

## The Process

1. [Get to know the customers](#users)
2. [Determine the use cases](#cases)
3. [Lay out the information](#IA)
4. [Visualize the final product](#visual)
5. [Test the usability](#usability)

### Get to Know the Customers {#users}

Preliminary analysis of competitors made it clear that the site was missing more modern features like online shopping and chatbots that frequently appear on other floral shop sites.
But to determine what the customers really wanted from Petal Pushers, I conducted user interviews.

<div class="caption"><i>My interview questions for first-time customers.</i></div>

![](/images/projects/petal-pushers/return-customers.png)

<div class="caption"><i>My interview questions for returning customers.</i></div>

From these interviews, two distinct personas emerged.

![](/images/projects/petal-pushers/primary-persona.png)

<div class="caption"><i>Primary persona: the student buyer.</i></div>

![](/images/projects/petal-pushers/secondary-persona.png)

<div class="caption"><i>Secondary persona: the supportive parent.</i></div>

While both personas make up large portions of the shop's customer base according to stakeholder interviews, the student buyer is more likely than the supportive parent to complete all their ordering online. 
This means that a new website may have the greatest impact on these customers and that this persona of the student buyer is my primary persona.

### Determine the Use Cases {#cases}

To better understand the needs and goals of the primary persona, I fleshed out a goal-directed context scenario and the three top use cases for the new site. 
The shop traditionally accepts requests, provides a client with options based on budget and preferences, and asks clients to select and pay for their arrangement prior to delivery. 
This structure is mimicked by the use cases:

**Use Case 1: Submit arrangement request**
1. User lands on homepage and clicks on "Shop Bestsellers"
2. User browses shop page and clicks "Add to Cart" under one of the arrangements
3. In the cart, user clicks "Request Arrangements" then "Log in to Order Online"
4. User enters login info and clicks "Log In"
5. User fills out online request form and clicks "Submit Arrangement Request"

**Use Case 2: Pay for arrangement**
1. User clicks on the user icon on the homepage, enters login info for an existing account, and clicks "Log In"
2. User sees current and past orders and within one of the orders, clicks "View Florist Message and Make Payment"
3. User reviews florist message and any updates to their order, then clicks "Purchase these Arrangements"
4. User enters their payment info and clicks "Purchase these Arrangements"

**Use Case 3: Track a Delivery**
1. User clicks on the user icon on the home page, enters login info for an existing account, and clicks "Log In"
2. User sees current and past orders and within one of the orders, clicks "View Delivery Status Details"
3. User views the delivery status of the arrangement


### Lay Out the Information {#IA}

After conducting user research and defining the desired experience of my primary persona, I began work on the information architecture by way of a site map.

![](/images/projects/petal-pushers/sitemap.png)

<div class="caption"><i>Sitemap for the new Petal Pushers site.</i></div>

The sitemap coupled with features and functionality lists and user flows took began to take form with wireframes created in Sketch. 
I created both desktop and mobile wireframes of the site as it needs to be responsive to match the needs of the users.

### Visualize the Final Product {#visual}

To determine if these designs meet the needs of my primary persona, I applied visual design principles to the mobile wireframes and turned those into a functional prototype so that I could test the functionality along with the look and feel of the site with potential users.

The shop owner asked that I keep the site "bright" as I recreated it, so when it came time to apply visual design, I chose a palette that worked well with the shop's content while also appearing bright. 
I incorporated green for key visual elements, shades of pink in the main image on the home page, and used a dark gray and white for all other elements so the site wouldn't appear overwhelming. 
I also redesigned the logo for the site so it would fit with this new palette and the overall more modern look of the site. 
Using this new color palette and logo along with new visual design elements brought the wireframes to life.

<div class="caption"><i>Home page (1.0), shop page (2.0), and item details modal (2.1) with visual design applied.</i></div>

To test the changes to the site and see if they met user needs, I first needed to add functionality to my site pages. 
I did this using prototyping links and hotspots in Sketch.

### Test the Usability {#usability}

With the functional prototype, I was able to begin usability testing. 
I needed to test the site with those that fit my personas to see if the design was clear enough that they could follow the use cases. 
The research plan below outlines the establishing questions and tasks I included in each test.

![](/images/projects/petal-pushers/research-plan.png)

<div class="caption"><i>Research plan outlining key components of the usability test.</i></div>

I used the tool Validately to conduct my unmoderated usability tests. 
Users who passed my screening questions (i.e. users who fit the persona) navigated through the prototype online while recording their screens and talking aloud. 
Below is a table quantifying the results of the usability testing.

<div class="caption"><i>Table showing average time to complete each task along with number of participants who passed and failed each task.</i></div>

With 75% of participants failing to complete their order after getting a message from the florist, the key finding of this study was that there needed to be clearer instructions and notifications to support this unique user flow.

## The Outcome {#outcome}

Because this was a university project, this app was not developed (but you can [check out the final prototype here](https://sketch.cloud/s/OyEqv/a/mGnVeL/play)). 
If I were to continue working on this project, **I would further simplify the user flow** by allowing users to place their order right away (with the caveat that arrangements are subject to change but the total cost will always be equal to or less than the listed price) and send them an email asking them to review any changes to their arrangements. 
The florist would be able to adapt the arrangement based on the current floral selection and they don't have to wait for the customer to respond to their messages. 
Thus, the simplified user flow would make the process easier for users and support business objectives of increasing revenue through online sales without changing the traditional operation methods.

If the website was developed, **I would use online sales numbers to assess the impact of the design on business objectives**. 
I would also check out the latest customer reviews and conduct additional rounds of user interviews to find ways of improving the site.

I greatly enjoyed the the chance to help a local business owner see how his shop could thrive online.
